# Javascript Array's!

- array's for javascript 
    slightly different than Python Array's.
    
    # ES6 Data Manipulation Project
## Overview
This project focuses on using ES6 features to manipulate data structures such as arrays, sets, and maps. The tasks involve creating and manipulating these data structures to perform specific operations, such as filtering, updating, and transforming data. The project demonstrates the use of modern JavaScript features like arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and built-in methods like map, filter, reduce, and Set.

## Key Concepts Covered
### Arrays:

Creating and manipulating arrays.

Using methods like map, filter, and reduce to transform and process data.

### Sets:

Creating sets and performing operations like filtering and checking for values.

Using sets to store unique values and perform set-specific operations.

### Maps:

Creating and updating maps.

Using maps to store key-value pairs and perform operations like updating values based on conditions.

### Error Handling:

Validating inputs and throwing errors when necessary.

## ES6 Features:

Utilizing arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, and default parameters.

- Tasks
- Basic Array Manipulation:

Create functions to return specific arrays or transform array data.

## Set Operations:

Create functions to work with sets, such as filtering values or checking for the existence of values.

## Map Operations:

Create functions to manipulate maps, such as updating values or creating maps from arrays.

## Data Transformation:

Combine multiple data structures and methods to perform complex data transformations.

## Error Handling:

Implement input validation and error handling to ensure functions work as expected.

## Conclusion
This project provides a hands-on approach to understanding and using ES6 features for data manipulation. By working with arrays, sets, and maps, you gain a deeper understanding of how to efficiently process and transform data in JavaScript. The tasks also emphasize the importance of writing clean, readable, and maintainable code using modern JavaScript practices.
